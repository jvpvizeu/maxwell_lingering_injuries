DC,Effect,Treatment
3,Arrhythmia,"Electricity surges into the core of your being, causing your heart to stutter. It is far more difficult for you to handle physical activity without becoming greatly fatigued. Any time you would take levels of exhaustion you take one additional level."
4,Cardiac Arrest,"As the electricity leaves your heart, it beats one last time before silence. You are unconscious and dying, your hit points drop to 0. If you are stabilized your heart gallops back to life, you are no longer unconscious, and your hit points return to the total they were at before they dropped to 0."
5,Muscle Avulsion,"Roll on the Large Limb Table. Your muscle has contracted so strongly that its been torn free of the bone. Your limb is nonfunctional and will not properly heal without surgery."
6,Personality Change,"Your brain has been damaged by the electrical surge and you're not acting like yourself. You take a flaw chosen randomly or by the DM. After each long rest roll a d20. On a 19 or 20, the flaw disappears."
7,Muscle Spasms,"Your muscles twitch in repetitive patterns and you have difficulty coordinating your movement. You have disadvantage on all Dexterity based attacks, checks, and saves for 1d4 turns."
8,Electrocution,"Your muscles seize, your eyes roll back, and you cannot seem to force your body to function. You are paralyzed until the end of your next turn."
9,True Electrocution,"Your body convulses and seizes, you can hardly even think, much less move it. You are paralyzed for 1d2 rounds."
10,Numbed Nerves,"Your nerves are shot, you feel numb, and you're having trouble making your body respond with the speed you need it to. You cannot take reactions for 1d4 days."
11,Grounding Scar,"Roll twice on the Scar Chart. Each area of your body is left with a round scar, one where the electricity entered, and one where the electricity left."
12,Lictenburg Figure,"Roll on the Scar Chart. This area of your body is left with a Lictenburg Figure, a scar resembling lightning that runs along the path the current took through your body."
13,Arc Flash,"The electricity's current has ignited you aflame. At the beginning of your turn, you take fire damage scaled to the damage that caused the lingering injury."
14,Lightning Rod,"The electricity crackles around your body for a second, looking for the closest thing to discharge to. The electricity then arcs from you to the nearest creature carrying metal weapons or wearing metal armor. This creature takes lightning damage equal to half the damage that caused the lingering injury."
15,Static Arc,"Roll on the Scar Chart. In a freak instance of chance, the electricity has interacted with a thread of natural magic within you. This body part emits a small electrical arc of energy every few minutes. If you use an action to touch this body part to a character with 0 hit points they become stable in the same manner as the Spare the Dying cantrip. You may suppress the arcing effect by maintaining concentration. The limb emits a faint aura of Evocation."
16,Destructive Grounding,"Roll on the Small Appendage Table. The electricity has violently exited your body at this point, charring it to the point of being nonfunctional."
17,Heart Palpitations,"Shocked through the heart, and you're to blame. Any time you are charmed or frightened you take 1 level of exhaustion."
18,Brain Injury,"The electricity lances across the wiring of your brain, short circuiting your neurons and changing you permanently. Your alignment shifts one step towards neutral on the law/chaos axis. If it is already neutral, treat this roll as a 15."
