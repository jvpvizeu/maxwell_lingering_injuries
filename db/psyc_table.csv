3 Apathy You mind has been indelibly altered, and you just find it more difficult to care. Your alignment shifts one

step towards neutral on the good/evil axis. If it is already neutral, treat this roll as a 15.

4 Crippling
Phobia
Unconsciously, you brain has made a connection between something random and the pain it felt, now you
can't help but associate the two. The DM chooses something unique about the source of the damage or
the current setting. Any time you move within 15 feet of this thing you are frightened until you move at
least 50 feet away from it.

5 Insomnia Your brain feels wired, and you cannot force it to rest no matter how hard you try. You cannot benefit from
short or long rests for 1d4 days (You do not regain HD, cannot regain spell slots or prepare spells, and do
not heal). During this time you are immune to magical sleep.

6 A Taste of
Madness
You feel something within your mind come a touch unhinged. Roll on the Long Term Madness Table (DMG
pg.260). This effect lasts 1d10 x 10 hours.

7 Terrified You feel a bubbling terror rising into your throat, and suddenly all you can think of is getting away. You are
terrified of the source of the damage as if affected by the Fear spell (saving throw DC equals half the
damage that caused the lingering injury or 10, whichever number is higher).

8 Frightened A sudden jolt of intense fear lances through you from your scalp to your toes. You are terrified of the

source of the damage as if affected by the Fear spell until the end of your next turn.

9 A Touch of
Madness
You feel your mind stretch as if to the point of breaking, and then all of the sudden things become clear
again. Roll on the Short Term Madness Table (DMG pg.259). This effect lasts for 1d10 minutes.

10 Persistent
Migraine
Your head throbs, the light aggravates you, and all you want is for the pounding to stop. You cannot benefit
from a short rest for 1d4 days.

11 Tic The psychic assault has left you with a small vocal or motor tic; a brief compulsive behavior you find
difficult or impossible to suppress. The DM may choose a specific tic or roll to determine the tic randomly
(1d6): 1) Eye twitching, 2) Finger clicking, 3) Touching other people or things, 4) Grunting, 5) Repeating a
sound or phrase, 6) Grimacing.

12 Nosebleeds You now tend to experience nosebleeds when you exert a great force of mental effort. The nosebleeds
occur when (roll 1d6): 1) You are frightened, 2) You are charmed, 3) You make an Intelligence saving throw,
4) You make a Wisdom saving throw, 5) You make a Charisma saving throw, 6) You take psychic damage.
13 Charmed Against all logic, you feel yourself becoming warm and endeared. You are charmed by the source of the
damage as if under the effects of the Charm Person spell. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
Treatment - Taking any amount of damage from the source of the charm ends this effect.

14 Enamoured A bit confused, you feel a wave of unexpected affection wash over you. You are charmed by the source of

the damage as if under the effects of the Charm Person spell. This effect lasts 1d4 rounds.
Treatment - Taking any amount of damage from the source of the charm ends this effect.

15 Illusory
Limb
Roll on the Scar Chart. In a freak instance of chance, the physic assault has interacted with a thread of
natural magic within you. The appearance of this body part keeps subtly shifting, though it feels exactly the
same as before. This area of your body is permanently under the effect of a Minor Illusion spell and emits a
faint aura of Illusion. You can suppress or control this effect with an effort of concentration, otherwise the
body part slowly shifts through minor changes in colour, size, shape, and appearance seemingly in relation
to your general mood. The spell save DC for this illusion is 10 + your current level.

16 Temporary
Aphasia
Your attempts to be understood are met with nothing but narrowed eyes and confused looks. You lose
proficiency with all languages except common, which you can understand, but not speak. You cannot read
or write. Any attempt to speak a language results in a garbled string of seemingly random words. This effect
lasts 1d4 days.
Treatment - Any spell that allows the caster to comprehend the literal or implied meaning of
communication will function as normal.

17 Night
Terrors
You tend to wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, the horrors you've seen replaying in your
mind. You regain only 1/4 of your HD on a long reast, instead of half (rounded down).

18 Paranoia You find it difficult to stop being distracted by the feeling that there is someone or something out to get
you. Whenever you must maintain concentration, roll 1d4. This is the maximum amount of rounds you may
maintain concentration for that spell or effect.
