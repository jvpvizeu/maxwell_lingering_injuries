DC,Effect,Treatment
3,Corrupted Soul,"You've bore witness to a deep darkness and even now you can feel its touch lingering on your soul. Your alignment shifts one step towards evil."
4,Tenuous Grip on Life,"You feel like you've seen the face of death and can recall its grim visage with ease. You require one less failed death saving throw before you die."
5,Necrotic Wound,"Your wound festers with a dark energy. It resists both magical and natural healing. Your maximum hit points are reduced by the amount of damage that caused the lingering injury."
6,Withered Away,"You feel frail, drained, as if your life's very essence has been stolen away from you. You have disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) checks and both Strength and Constitution saving throws for 1d4 days."
7,Malicious Outburst,"You are filled with a blind rage and an overwhelming violent compulsion. You immediately use your reaction to make a melee attack against the nearest creature (at random). You spend the next 1d4 turns pursuing and attacking whatever creature is closest to you, regardless of if they are friendly or not."
8,Sorrow,"All positive emotion within you shatters like a mirror are you are left only with painful, distracting shards. If you have Inspiration, you lose it. You lose any nonmagical effect granting you a temporary bonus or advantage (such as Bardic Inspiration, Barbarian Rage, the Dodge action, or the Help action)."
9,The Stench of Decay,"Your are plagued by the lingering stench of rotting flesh. It clings to you and is perceivable by anyone within 5 feet of you. For 1d6 days you have disadvantage on all Charisma based checks."
10,Cursed,"You feel the negative energy latching on to you, actively working against you. You are afflicted as if by the Bestow Curse spell, with the specific curse chosen at random, or by the DM. The curse lasts until the next sunrise."
11,Shadow Scar,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with a curious scar that appears to be a shadow over the wounded area. No amount of light seems to be able to eliminate this shadow."
12,Dark Vessels,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with a lingering blackness along the veins in this area of your body."

15,Phantom Limb,"Roll on the Large Limb Table. This limb is pale, bloodless, and dead. Yet somehow...you can still move it normally. The limb emits a faint aura of Necromancy. This renders your physical limb inanimate and a ghostly, phantom limb appears from within it, staying attached to you. This incorporeal limb can pass through creatures and objects and interact with both the Material Plane and the Border Ethereal Plane. If the Phantom Limb ever spends more than 6 seconds inside an object, it flickers from existence and you take 1d6 force damage."
16,Insidious Compulsion,"Slowly, you feel the building urge to destroy something beautiful. You have 1d6 days to commit an act of senseless destruction or violence (outside of what would be normal behavior for your character). If you do not do this within the time limit, the compulsion builds to distracting levels, and you have disadvantage to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until you do."
