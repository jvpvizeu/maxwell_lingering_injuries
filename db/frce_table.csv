3,Third EyeBlinded,"Something vital, yet intangible within you falls deathly silent. You feel...disconnected. You lose the ability tocommunicate telepathically. All magical communication that specifically targets you fails (such as theMessage, Sending, and Telepathic Bond spells). Your mind cannot be read or detected.",5,Null Arcana,"As the arcane energy strikes you, you feel something within you sputter and fizzle. You lose the ability tocast spells through any means (including class features, racial traits, or magical items) for 1d4 days.",7,Wild MagicFeedback,"An errant thread of magic comes loose, slipping away from you and causing havoc. The creature or sourceof the damage rolls on the Wild Magic Surge Table (PHB pg.104).",9,Null Scola,You can feel the magic pulse and resonate with the arcane residue that clings to you from the last spell youcast. There's a searing feeling deep in your mind. You lose the ability to cast spells from the same school ofmagic as the most recent spell you've cast for 1d4 days.,11,LingeringAura,"Roll on the Scar Chart. Sometimes there are strange side effects when you deal with raw magical energy.This body part emits faint, misty whisps of arcane energy with the following color and faint magical aura(roll 1d4): 1) Orange, Conjuration, 2) Red, Evocation, 3) Blue, Abjuration, 4) Green, Transmutation.",13,Mana Burn,You feel the energy tug violently at your arcane essence until a portion of it tears loose. One of the highestlevel spell slots you have available to cast is harmless expended. You may reprepare this spell slot as usualafter a long rest or as your class dictates.,15,ImbuantArtus,"Roll on the Large Limb Table. When the arcane energy has been expelled and the pain recedes, you flexyour limb and find some of that energy has decided to stick with you. Unarmed strikes and weaponswielded by this limb count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.",17,AnathemaMagicka,"You shake your head from the force of the arcane blow and, it's gone. The knowledge, that is, not yourhead. You lose the ability to cast your most recently cast spell permanently. You can never cast this spellagain by any means (including class features, racial traits, or magical items). If your class allows you toreplace spells on your spell list when leveling up, you may replace this spell normally."
