DC,Effect,Treatment
3,Gouged Right Eye,"You've taken grievous damage directly to your right eye. Your eye is nonfunctional. If untreated within 8 hours, your vision will be beyond saving (and be considered missing)."
4,Severed Nerve,"Roll on the Large Limb Table. Through precision or just sheer luck, the blow has severed a nerve in one of your major limbs. This limb is nonfunctional and will not heal properly without surgery."
5,Severed Small Nerve,"Roll on the Small Appendage Table. You feel a stabbing pain in your appendage, and then an instant numbness. The appendage is nonfunctional and will not heal properly without surgery."
6,Deep Infection,"The superficial wound closes easily, but the attack has left an insidious contamination deep inside. At the end of every long rest, roll your class's hit die and reduce your max hit points by this amount. If this effect reduces your hit points to 0, you fall unconscious and will die in 1d6 days."
7,Deep Perforation,"You bite back a snarl as the attack penetrates just a little bit deeper. You take one extra damage die of whatever type the damage was dealt with."
8,Punctured Arm,"The attack sinks into the meat of your arm. It's probably not serious, but the pain makes you treat your arm gingerly. You no longer get one free object interaction per turn. This effect lasts 1d8 turns."
9,Punctured Lung,"You cough up blood. The wound has made it past your ribs and into your lung. You make Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks at disadvantage for 1d6 days."
10,Ran Through,"The attack went in one end and out the other. Luckily, it's missed anything vital, but you can still feel the agony of it in every motion you make. Bonus actions require a full action instead. This effect lasts for 1d4 days."
11,Gnarled Scar,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with a raised, gnarled scar on this area of your body."
12,Depressed Scar,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with an indented, depressed scar on this area of your body."
13,Punctured Leg,"The attack sinks into the meat of your leg. It's probably not serious, but the pain of it makes you treat your leg gingerly. Your speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1d8 rounds."
14,Visceral Pain,"What did that attack even hit? Your liver? Your spleen? Whatever it was, who knew it could hurt so much? You let out an ear-splitting cry of pain. If they enemy wasn't aware of you, they sure are now. Every creature within 60 feet of you knows your exact location, and you are no longer hidden."
15,Roguish Scar,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with a scar that somehow gives you a distinct roguish charm. When this scar is visible you have a +1 bonus to Charisma (Deception) checks. If you collect multiple Roguish Scars, this bonus does not stack."
16,Foreign Body,"The attack is over, but it's left something left behind. An arrowhead, a chip from the creature's tooth, or the broken point of a sword, perhaps. Whatever it is, you can still feel it cutting within you. Any time you use an action, bonus action, and movement on the same turn you are incapacitated until the end of your next turn."
17,Perforated Gut,"You look down at your stomach and a wave of cold fear washes over you. You've taken a gut wound, and it's only a matter of time until it turns septic. You are poisoned. Every 24 hours you gain 1 level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion may not be removed by nonmagical means."
18,Gouged Left Eye,"You've taken grievous damage directly to your left eye. Your eye is nonfunctional. If untreated within 8 hours, your vision will be beyond saving (and be considered missing)."
