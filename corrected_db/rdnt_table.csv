3,Purged Soul,"The purging light has scoured clean the filth in your soul. Your alignment shifts one step towards good. If your alignment is already good, treat this roll as a 15."
4,Blinded,"Roll randomly for the right or left eye. Even through closed lids all you can see is an empty whiteness. Your eye is nonfunctional, and if not treated within 24 hours your vision will be permanently missing. Treatment - A DC 20 Save Sense Surgery."
5,Irradiated,"The energy that washed over you has left you with a lingering feeling of sickness and nausea. You are poisoned for 1d4 days. During this time, you slowly lose all the hair on your body. After 1d12 days, it begins to regrow at the normal rate."
6,Flash Burn,"You were unprepared for the overwhelming torrent of brilliance and stared right into it. You are blinded for 1d6 days. Treatment - A DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check reduces this injury's duration by 1d4 days."
7,Razzle Dazzled,"You blink the spots from your eyes, but your vision is taking a while to return. You are blinded for 1d4 turns. Treatment - A Lesser Restoration spell will cure this condition as usual."
8,Dazzled,"Lights dance in your vision and you shake your head in an attempt to clear it. You are blinded until the end of your next turn. Treatment - A Lesser Restoration spell will cure this condition as usual."
9,Unearthly Glow,"Oddly, after the radiance of the attack fades you are left with a dull, green glow. This affects you in the same manner as the Faerie Fire spell, though the effect itself is non-magical. It last 1d20 hours."
10,Penitent Mercy,"You seem to have lost your stomach for killing. The thought of taking a life fills you with abject disgust. You may not willingly take a life. Any damage dealt by you that reduces a creatureâ€™s hit points to 0 automatically knocks them out instead of killing them. This effect lasts 1d4 days."
11,Prismatic Scar,"Roll on the Scar Chart. You are left with smooth scar on this part of your body that seems to shimmer through the prismatic colors when the light catches it."
12,Bleached,"Roll on the Scar Chart. This area of your body is left bleached a bone white, and hair no longer grows on it."
13,Sunburn,"The light sears a painful red burn into your skin. You take 1 radiant damage per 10 feet of movement while on initiative. This injury lasts 1d4 days. Treatment - A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check reduces this injury's duration by 1d4 days."
14,A Brief Stillness of the Soul,"You've received a brief glimpse of something greater and you can't help but pause for a moment of distracted contemplation. You cannot take reactions for 1d4 turns."
15,Halo,"Roll on the Scar Chart. This area of your body flares with a sudden radiance, which then dies down to a soft, dull glow. It emits bright light in a 5 foot radius, dim light in an additional 5 foot radius, and has a faint aura of Evocation. An effort of concentration can either suppress this effect or flare the light to the brightness of a torch."
16,Forced Epiphany,"As the energy of the attack passes, you have a revelation clawing at the edge of your brain, you're sure of it. You have 1d6 days to withdraw from activity and spend 24 hours alone in silent, individual contemplation about your god, belief set, or yourself. After this, you come to an enlightening realization. If you do not do this within the time limit, the nagging urge builds to distracting levels and you have disadvantage to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until you do."
17,Fountain of Youth,"As the divine energy fades you feel as if some of the great burden of time has left with it. Your body is 1d10 years younger. Your mind is unaffected."
18,Seen the Light,"You feel as if you've seen a glimpse of something greater than yourself, and a tiny mote of that light has come to rest on your soul. You take a flaw that would be considered benevolent, self-sacrificing, unyielding, or militant."
